Note on terminology:

\begin{description}
    \item[Image Analysis] Low to mid level, early vision (Image processing/enhancement, Image segmentation, depth, motion, features)
    \item[Computer Vision] High level, scene interpretation (Models: 3D, Texture, Lighting; Recognition: Objects, activities..)
\end{description}

Summary:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CV deals with difficult inverse problems
    \item Many different cues about a scene in images
    \item Emulate human gain information
    \item Human perception of visual illusions gives deep insight
    \item IA investigate images on low level, to feed information into high level algos.
\end{itemize}
